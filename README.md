## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned


-Selectors are pretty important, it makes your work simple and easy wwhen applying the css custom properties such as the id, class and many more

some of my fav code that got me pumped as a beginner,
see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```<div id="main">
  <img class="image"  src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qrcode">


  <div>
 <h1> Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>

  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>
</div>
    }
```
```css

    #main{
      display: grid;
      align-items: center;
      border:8px solid  hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      border-radius: 20px;
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      margin:400px;
      padding:20px ;
      max-width: 50%;
      height: auto;
    }
} 
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on the variouse aspects of CSS and refine my skill set in further projects
### Useful resources
